-- A
-- Write a functio that given the coefficients of a quadriatic a, b, and c will return how many roots the equation has

numberNDroots :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Integer

-- B
-- Using your answer to the last question write a function that given the coefficients of the quadratic, a, b and c
-- will return haw many roots the equation has. In the cas that the equation has every number a root you should return the result 3.

numberRoots :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Integer

-- C
-- Write definitions of the functions which return the smaller and larger real roots of the quadratic. 
-- In the case that the equation has no real roots or has all values as roots you should 
-- return zero as the result of each of the functions.
